    <h1 class="">About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Con, I am a 24 year old software Developer with a passion for gaming. I have always been fascinated by games, there is simply no other medium in the world that is able to entertain you while allowing you to learn different assets of skills and apply it to life in meaningful ways. This was definitely not an excuse for me to procrastinate and play games.</p>
    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <p>This site is a pet project of mine where I place all my thoughts regarding games ranging anywhere from dumb fun games to game reviews to general knowledge about games while hopefully keeping you entertained and away from drugs and alcohol</p>
    <h2>What is the Misc tab?</h2>
    <p>The Misc tab as it stands is just a place where I leave my ideas for a project.</p>
    <h2>What is your favorite game of all time?</h2>
    <p>Well this is a loaded question init... This is an eternal debate with myself on this topic and I'm starting to realize I will never reach a conclusion, the first was Tales of the Abyss (PS2 mind you, not 3ds), second is YS 8: Lacrimosa Of Dana, both brilliant games with a very unique take on the action genre, topped of by brilliant and fitting soundtracks and compelling story that simply lives rent free in my head.</p>
    <h2>What is your favorite genre</h2>
    <p>Some of my favorite genres are roguelikes, strategy, and card games but I tend to lean towards RPGs, turn based or action leaning more towards turn based. Yes, I know 2 of my best game of all time are action RPGs, but they are exceptions as they both took such a unique spin on the action genre, that I simply had to give them extra points. In short, no you.</p>
