    <h1 id="Intro">Trails in the Sky FC</h1>
    <p>In an age where one off RPGs are massively popular, the Trails franchise looks to stand out of the crowd by sheer ambition. An ambition so big, that it would span across decades, between tens of games, under 1 (small indie) company named Falcom, and a world so engrossing it leaves you thinking “what in Narnia just happened”. The first of these games is Trails in the Sky FC, FC for “First Chapter” yea mind-blowing I know.</p>

    <p id="Story">The premise of the game seemed quite simple at first glance - you follow Estelle and Joshua and their journey across Liberl as rookies of an organization called Bracer guild that exist to help civilians and solve issues of all matter from simple errands to monster extermination. In their journey they find themselves in various incidents happening in Liberl and learn about the spirit of a bracer in the process. But as you might imagine, Falcom puts a lot of effort in world building - and it shows. </p>
    <p>Every chapter is like painting a side of a wall through not just plot but actions of characters from the inhumane crimes of a noble to a silly romcom banter(seriously, get a room already), every scene seems to be full of tidbits of information about Liberl, Erebonia or just the world of Zemuria and each countries culture. But most impressively, for a game with so much dialogue, it manages to still keep the tidbits short and concise. Before I knew it I was already too engrossed into the world and finding it hard to put the game down.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my 60 hour playthrough, I'm pleasantly surprised that the devs have spent just as much time on its side characters as its main cast. From mayors (Maybelle supremacy) to a slightly senile if not overbearing old man in a lighthouse (or an infuriatingly loving couple). Through the various side quests that you would take on in your journey, you not only help them but also get a genuine chance to learn more about these characters whether it’s a lonely old man, workaholic or just an outright dunce.</p>
    <p>While I certainly did not like all of them, I appreciate all of them. “Why” you might ask. Now I could give you a generic answer such as “the devs worked hard on these characters”, but the real answer would be “It makes the world more believable”. Much like in the real world, you shouldn’t expect to love/like/hate everyone you meet, learning more about someone might make you hate them, but also might make you like them or better, fall in love with him/her. Like and hate, love and detest these are all part of what gives meaning to the word life, and life is certainly 1 thing that is brimming in the world of Zemuria.</p>

    <p>Every revelation, I felt like I was understanding the way of life in Liberl, they have a sense of Unity, each relying on another to cover their own weaknesses, kind of like how the army relies on bracers to help citizens on smaller scale and often odd jobs so that the army can focus on fending off neighboring warmonger nations. Drawing a clear line of priorities on both parties about their responsibilities and limits was a very grounded decision from the writers and a very gratifying experience personally as it helps make the world more believable and for me, that much more invested in the world more so than the plot itself. But that’s enough about the story, as a wise old man once said, “I can do this all day” (but not without spoilers).</p>
    <p  id="Gameplay">Sky FC is a turn based game, but as with any JRPG they have added a twist to the original formula. In this case, the devs have added grids of tactics games into the mix as well as their homebrewed AT(action turn) system. In this system, every action of a character is associated with a delay before they can act again, and when I say every action, I mean EVERYTHING from walking to using items, it all adds different amount of delay, these delays could be mitigated by the Orbments system for cast time for spells and speed for all other actions which we’ll talk about later. </p>

    <p>This creates an interesting dynamic in the game where you have to keep in mind constantly, the typical notion of "this does the most damage so use this" now comes with an added risk of getting killed by an additional hit from enemies before getting another turn. I will preface however, that while the gameplay can be easily broken like a twig with a certain over-tuned status effect, there are still enough challenges in the game to keep me on my toes and engaged.</p>
    <p>I would also like to point out that this game puts a lot of emphasis on physical/magical resistances, even if the game itself might not show you. For example in chapter 1 there are plants that are resistant to physical but almost always will get 1 shot by a fire spell. </p>
    <p>In contrast, chapter 4 is filled with monsters that are resistant to magic hence physical would be favored. This combined with both our protagonists being able to spec into both magic/phys build meant a nice change of pace in fights throughout the game. Now sadly, this falls slightly apart as you approach the endgame as most enemies will take just as much damage from physical than spells. But overall it's well balanced enough to keep fights refreshing and presents enough obstacles to prevent you from only using 1 tactic throughout the game.</p>
    <p>Sky FC also introduces something called "Orbments system" this system allows you to insert an Orbment and gain various stat bonuses and septium (element crystals), each spell has a set amount of septium you have to reach to obtain said skill. This again creates an interesting problem where the optimal route may not always be obvious. </p>

    <p>In a normal setting you might think "this character is a physical damage dealer so give him STR and SPD" but doing so may lead to situations where against physical resistant enemies, his character would be a dead weight. So to keep a character useful enough but still able to do their job would often involve balanced support spells and stats/atk spells. Or in a boss case, to keep an open mind on what role a character can play in a fight.</p>
    <p>One problem with the gameplay I would like to point out however is the Tactics menu, This menu lets you customize your battle formation when entering the battle. In combat, the grid is made up of 17x17 - but the tactics menu only lets you make a formation within the size of 7x5. I understand that 5 vertical is due to separating enemies and units so that fights don’t become a slog, but in all honesty, 7x5 is simply too small to have any impactful strategies. This is especially apparent in later parts of the game where medium sized aoe are common, you would have to position units at the edge of the grid to avoid aoe, leaving many questions as to why the middle grids are even there if not as a formality.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, this game is certainly not too difficult in normal, or even hard mode, Nightmare mode on the other hand is a completely different story. While nightmare and hard both only multiply enemy stats, it is only really in nightmare where SPD bares its fangs and cements itself to be the best stat in the game, it is not surprising at all for enemies to take 2-3 turns before some of your characters even take 1. For this reason, I would highly recommend new players to stay away from nightmare mode.It is worth noting however that if you did already start your game on nightmare and sorely regret that choice, there is atleast a retry offset option that weakens enemies every time you lose in a fight.</p>

    <p id="Music">The soundtracks of this game, while may not be the greatest - are at least very fitting. The bustling noise of trades happening in Bose, the chimes of sea in the port town Ruan, and the soothing sounds of the river in our(ok fine protagonists) home.</p>
    <p>While Sky FC is by no means a visually impressive game, it does have the sort of 20s charm back in the day, between its mood defining emojis and 2.5D models. While this may be a little jarring coming from people who started this series from Cold Steel or Kuro, I still highly encourage you to give it a chance as it certainly grew on me over time.</p>
    <p id="Final Thoughts">All in all, a spectacular game. Pacing turned out to be relatively slow but slow burns are often the most memorable. This is especially true for Sky FC, It takes its time to build up its characters, slowly adding layers of personality on each of them whilst spreading the culture of Liberl. However, this being a story split into 2 games, as great as this game is, the true test of writing and story-telling remains to be seen in the second game, Sky SC.</p>
