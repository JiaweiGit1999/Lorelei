    <h1 id="Intro">Phantom Blade 0 shows the potential of Wuxia in games</h1>
    <p id="Intro"><b>Phantom Blade 0</b> - If you haven’t heard the news yet, is a newly announced game by S-Game, It is a souls-like game set in the ancient times of China, featuring many aspects resembling a wuxia novel, such as demons, royal armies etc. Initial impressions for this game already went through the roof but the AAA industry in China has already shown in the past that releasing a trailer means very little as seen in <a rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2nNljv0MOw">Black Myth Wukong</a> first announced 3 years ago.</p>

    <p id="Wuxia">But skepticism aside, Phantom Blade 0 does show a lot of promise and a side of China that hasn’t been explored a lot in games despite being around for almost 2 decades. That aspect of course is Wuxia - For those who don't know, Wuxia is a very common and popular genre in China that I personally am a fan of, although maybe not for the same reason most people do. The Wuxia genre basically indicates the show is set in ancient China, where law and order doesn't exactly exist outside of the kingdom walls, so bandits and mercenaries are all very common professions outside of the kingdom. However, other iconic aspect of Wuxia are demons (especially those disguised as humans!), schools of martial arts, cultivation and many deserted temples/towns.</p>
    <p>However, where all this becomes interesting to me, is when politics comes into play, between the people who prefer to roam in the wild outside the authority of the King and its established systems and the kingdom rulers themselves. The Kingdom rulers often want these men to join the kingdom as they pose a threat due to their naturally high skill and proficiency in the martial arts from living on the edge everyday in such cruel environments. This often leads to interesting clashes of ideals like a prince loving the freedom outside of the kingdom but is bound to the responsibility of the throne.</p>

    <p id="Game industry in China">As you might imagine, Wuxia is a genre that is very heavy on world building through indirect events such as martial arts matches, escaping from the kingdom army and meeting demons both good and bad. Sounds familiar? These are all aspects that souls-like games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring excels at, these games are specifically designed to let events and the world speak for itself. So then now it begs the question, Dark Souls has been an infamous name for nearly a decade now, so why has it taken this long for someone to connect the lines between Wuxia and souls-like?</p>
    <p>The answer - is that the game industry in China has long been dominated by the mobile market, souls-like are time consuming games that challenges the players and forces the player to learn from their mistakes, it embraces the concept of “dying is not the end”. Which is all fine and dandy by itself, but in China and the rest of Asia work culture is quite harsh often exhausted in a normal work day due to the high competition and thus stress which results in preference to short bursts of gaming sessions instead to help people through the day-to-day hence the booming market of mobile games on regions such as China and Japan. This results in a relatively low amount of AAA games from china even if there are a fair amount of indies such as <a rel="external" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1468810/_Tale_of_Immortal/">Tale of Immortal</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13i4y1Q7nt/?spm_id_from=333.788.b_7265636f5f6c697374.1">Jin YiWei</a>, but none of them have managed to penetrate the international market partly due to the fact that casuals lean more towards AAA games but mostly due to the lack of marketing power that comes with being a “AAA game” thanks to the bigger budget(not to mention half of them are in development hell or just straight MIA).</p>
    <img class="post-imgs" src="{{myProject.host}}/src/img/phantomblade0/thoughts.jpg" alt="no named warrior who appears to be from the kingdom">
    <p id="Final Thoughts">Regardless, Phantom Blade 0 does show a lot of potential purely because it plays to the strengths of Wuxia genre, but this being one of the few AAA games from China that reaches international audience combined with the fact that Asians tend to prefer short and accessible game aka on phone, I am very worried of what happens if this game (and Black Myth Wukong) does end up bombing (god please be good) it might scare the developers away from the AAA market and we will be right back where we started - assuming either of these games even come out of course... pretty please?</p>
